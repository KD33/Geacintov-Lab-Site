              The relationships between the chemical, structural, and biological aspects of DNA
              damage have long been parallel and overlapping research domains. More recently,
              interest has intensified in relating the structural characteristics of DNA damage
              with its ultimate manifestation – the development of human disease. New opportunities
              for moving the field forward and for gaining a better understanding of
              the molecular basis of diseases associated with DNA damage are emerging. Rapid
              advances in instrumentation and computing power are yielding new structural
              information on macromolecular biological systems and assemblies through highresolution
              structural studies at the molecular level. The subject of this book, the
              chemical biology of DNA damage, offers the opportunity for considering DNA
              damage from the molecular perspective with a focus on both the chemical elements
              at the level of damage generation and the biological properties of the various
              types of damage from the structure–function points of view.
              The topics covered in this book should be of interest to researchers who wish
              to gain an overview of the frontier areas of the field, as well as to students who
              wish to learn or deepen their knowledge in areas that touch on the molecular
              origins of disease via DNA damage. Another objective of this book is to foster
              communication between the chemical and biological communities of researchers
              by highlighting the molecular origins that unite these topics at a fundamental
              level. The time is ripe for promoting such a fundamental understanding since new
              information on the biological impact of chemically defined lesions is now becoming
              available at an increasing pace.
              This book is divided into two parts. The focus of Part One is on the chemical
              aspects of DNA damage, while the emphasis of Part Two is on the structural and
              functional relationships of DNA lesions, and their processing by the cellular
              machineries of repair, replication, and transcription. Chapter 1 in Part One is
              intended as a brief overview of the vast field of DNA damage, and introduces the
              reader to the relationships between the chemical and structural aspects of DNA
              damage, and some of the known biological endpoints and correlations with human
              disease. Ample references are provided with an emphasis on authoritative, recently
              published reviews to guide the interested reader.
              The two parts of this book, the chemical and the biological components, spring
              from the same tree and feed from the same roots – the chemical and structural
              features of DNA lesions that influence the biological consequences by alterations
              of the normal structural features of the DNA molecule. Understanding phenomena
              at the intersections of chemical and biological disciplines is at the frontier of
              our current knowledge. It is our belief that a deeper understanding of the connections
              between these disciplines will lead to more effective strategies for preventing
              disease and to advanced therapeutic approaches for treating diseases such as
              human cancers.
