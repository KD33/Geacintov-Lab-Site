       <div align="left">Human genomic  DNA is under constant assault by endogenous reactive oxidizing chemical species  present in the human body and by environmental  contaminants that are metabolized to reactive intermediates that bind covalently  to DNA bases.  If not removed by cellular  defense systems (DNA repair), these DNA lesions will interfere with the  transcription and replication of DNA and can cause the mutagenic insertion of  the incorrect bases in the RNA transcripts and newly synthesized DNA  molecules.&nbsp;&nbsp;An accumulation of such mutations can lead to  cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the detailed mechanisms of these phenomena may  led to novel strategies for preventing this and other genetic diseases that are  caused by the chemical alterations of normal DNA, as well as the design of more  effective chemotherapeutic drugs.&nbsp;The overall objectives are to understand  the formation and the removal  of  DNA lesions by cellular defense mechanisms.                            </div>
      <p align="left">Our laboratory emphasizes studies  of DNA model systems that     are based  on well defined oligonucleotides with single, chemically characterized,  modified nucleic acid bases&nbsp;(DNA lesions) embedded either in protein-free  DNA, or in DNA      associated with  nucleosomes, the building blocks of cellular chromatin.&nbsp; Our major interests  are to relate the structural features of DNA lesions to their recognition and  removal by the human nucleotide excision repair (NER) system.  The eukaryotic NER apparatus removes an  astounding variety of    chemically and  structurally different DNA lesions, but with variable efficiencies â€“ while many  lesions are removed efficiently, some are resistant to NER.   Our hypothesis is that the efficiency of NER  is dictated by the repair-initiating recognition step that involves the binding  of a specialized protein dimer to the DNA lesions, and that this step depends  on the local distortions and destabilization of the local, normally  double-helical, hydrogen-bonded base pair structure.  </p>

       <div align="left">The DNA lesions being studied include those  derived from cellular metabolites of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)  that are environmentally ubiquitous fossil  fuel combustion products, heterocyclic aromatic  amines that are present in broiled and other foods cooked at high temperatures,  equine estrogens present in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) formulations, and  small reactive free radical intermediates that are generated in cells during  the inflammatory response.  Our approach  is interdisciplinary that involves the synthesis and purification of  site-specifically modified oligonucleotides containing single, well defined  lesions in defined base sequence contexts, their structural characterizations  by solution NMR and other thermochemical and biophysical techniques, and  nucleotide excision repair assays in human cell extracts, or using purified  enzymes.  In order to explore the molecular  bases of structure-DNA repair efficiency relationships, we are relying on  computational and molecular modeling techniques in collaboration with  Professor Suse Broyde (Biology Department,  NYU).      </div>
